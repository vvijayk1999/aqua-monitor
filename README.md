# Aqua Monitor 💧

Aqua Monitor is a comprehensive web application dedicated to monitoring and managing water usage efficiently.

## Overview 🌐

Aqua Monitor integrates a microcontroller-based system to measure water consumption, providing users with insightful data on their usage patterns. The platform enables users to review their historical water consumption, set personal limits, and receive timely notifications. Administrators have the added capability to monitor and regulate water usage for enhanced control.

## Problem Statement ❌

The unregulated use of water, coupled with instances of excess consumption and undetected leaks, poses environmental and economic challenges. Aqua Monitor aims to address these issues by promoting responsible water usage.

### Goal 🎯
The primary goal of Aqua Monitor is to monitor water usage effectively, thereby discouraging excessive consumption and contributing to environmental conservation.
